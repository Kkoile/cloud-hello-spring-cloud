SAP HANA Cloud Platform Samples - hello spring cloud
========

This project demonstrates the usage of [Spring Cloud Connectors](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/) within a classic web application. In fact, it's a fork/rewrite of a [sample application](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/hello-spring-cloud) provided as part of the Cloud Foundry samples.

The main differences between the original sample and this fork/rewrite are as follows:

+ the original version used Spring Boot, this fork sticks to the classic approach of Spring
+ the original version compiles to a JAR file, this fork uses the classic WAR format for deployment
+ this fork provides the needed dependencies to run the application on the [SAP HANA Cloud Platform](http://hcp.sap.com)
